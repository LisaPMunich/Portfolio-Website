      <h3 class="about__underline-effect">What do I bring to the table as a developer?</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a web developer with professional experience in product management and interface positions.
        I know how to organise myself within the time constraints of a project and align interests with colleagues from different departments. My experience as a branding and naming specialist has also taught me the importance of incorporating the customer perspective into the product.
        </p>
      <p>
        Having spent two years alone in China - the first time at 16 - has taught me to self-reliantly find solutions and simply continue trying when encountering an obstacle. I did not give up easily, when I subsequently studied business Chinese, in contrary it definitely coined my drive and attention to detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now as a developer, when doing a project, I do not shy away when an application suddenly throws errors, but always strive to find solutions - with the help of documentation, forums, tutorials, by rolling back or simply asking around fellow developers. Also, my attention to detail comes in handy when finding bugs and doing quality assurance.
      </p>



      <h3 class="about__underline-effect">What I am looking for?</h3>
      <p>
        I’m looking to collaborate on any amazing projects with a good cause. If it is outside my current scope, the better. I am willing to study intensely to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional goal is to find a full-time position at a remote-first company, that works with an agile mindset and supports regular process retrospectives to continuously learn and improve. I am looking for a role in a positive team, where we can share knowledge to build visually appealing and user-focussed web applications.
      </p>

      <h3 class="about__underline-effect">This is what I enjoy doing - apart from coding:</h3>
      <ul class="fun-activities-list">
        <li>long walks with my dog around lakes and through forests in the countryside around Munich.</li>
        <li>family time. Cuddling, goofing around with my children, reading to them from books I liked in my childhood.</li>
        <li>Upcycling of old furniture.</li>
        <li>Digging through my garden and getting dirt on my hands after hours of clean coding.</li>
        <li>Yoga. Silence.</li>
        <li>Indoor Climbing.</li>
      </ul>
