      <h2 class="about__underline-effect">What do I bring to the table as a developer?</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a web developer with professional experience in product management and interface positions.
        I know how to organize myself within the time constraints of a project and align interests with colleagues from
        different departments. My experience as a branding and naming specialist has also taught me the importance of
        incorporating the customer perspective into the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having spent two years alone in China - the first time at 16 - has taught me to self-reliantly find solutions
        and continue trying when encountering an obstacle. I did not give up easily when I subsequently studied business
        Chinese, in contrary it coined my drive and attention to detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, as a developer, when doing a project, I do not shy away when an application suddenly throws errors but
        always strive to find solutions - with the help of documentation, forums, tutorials, by rolling back or simply
        asking fellow developers. I believe in life-long-learning and am always willing to expand my horizon and learn
        something completely new. Also, my attention to detail comes in handy when finding bugs and doing quality
        assurance.
      </p>


      <h2 class="about__underline-effect">What I am looking for?</h2>
      <p>
        I’m looking to collaborate on projects with a good cause. If it is outside my current scope, the better. I am
        willing to study intensely to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional goal is to find a full-time position at a remote-first company that works with an agile mindset
        and supports structured process retrospectives to learn and improve continuously. I am looking for a role in a
        positive team, where we can share knowledge to build visually appealing and user-focused web applications.
      </p>

      <h2 class="about__underline-effect">This is what I enjoy doing - apart from coding:</h2>
      <ul class="fun-activities-list">
        <li>Long walks with my dog around lakes and through forests in the countryside around Munich.</li>
        <li>Family time. Cuddling, goofing around with my children, reading to them from books I liked in my
          childhood.
        </li>
        <li>Upcycling of old furniture.</li>
        <li>Digging through my garden and getting dirt on my hands after hours of clean coding.</li>
        <li>Yoga. Silence.</li>
        <li>Indoor Climbing.</li>
      </ul>
