## Description
This is the website exhibiting my projects as a web developer.

## Version History
I built the **first version** in order to learn HTML and CSS/SCSS in February/March 2022.

The **second version** from June 2022 was created when I included a hamburger menu and a grid for my recent projects. I also used pure html5 and css3 here. 

For the **third version** in August - prior to finishing my CareerFoundry bootcamp - I finally installed webpack and added JavaScript in order to include a testimonial slider.
